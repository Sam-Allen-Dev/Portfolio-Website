        <p>
          This is private software which was created by the development team at Cove Co. for Future Institute of Australia to assist in their report writing process.
          Our initial job description was to create an application which could interpret the data they were exporting from a SurveyMonkey service, and convert it into four types of pdf reports.

          <br><br>

          Over time, this product has had several updates as requested by Future Instutute.
          This has changed aspects such as the data which can be read, the UI/UX design, and the number of reports which can be exported.

          <br><br>

          Execution Phase 1
          <br><br>
        </h5>
        <p>
          When the project was initially requested by Future Institute we had given a quote based on the amount of hours we expected it to take, and multiplied it by an hourly rate we were happy to be paid.
          The project took a two week period to complete, including an additional week for testing and minor cosmetic changes.

          <br><br>

          The original application was written in python.
          This was to ensure we could expand the project to support the SurveyMonkey API.
          Reports were compiled using LaTeX through the pyLateX plugin.
