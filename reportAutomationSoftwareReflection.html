        <p>
          Private software which was created by the development team at Cove Co. for Future Institute of Australia to assist in their report writing process.
          Our initial job description was to create an application which could interpret the data Future Institute were exporting from a SurveyMonkey service, and convert it into four types of pdf reports.

          <br><br>

          Over time, this product has had several updates as requested by Future Instutute.
          This has changed aspects such as the data which can be read, the UI/UX design, and the number of reports which can be exported.

          <br><br>
        </p>
        <h5>
          Execution
          <br><br>
        </h5>
        <p>
          When the project was initially requested by Future Institute we had given a quote based on the amount of hours we expected it to take, and multiplied it by an hourly rate we were happy to be paid.
          The project took a two week period to complete, including an additional week for testing and minor cosmetic changes.

          <br><br>

          The original application was written in python.
          This was to ensure we could expand the project to support the SurveyMonkey API.
          Reports were compiled using LaTeX through the pyLateX plugin.

          <br><br>

        </h5>
        <p>
          We kept consistent and clear communication with the client throughout development which lead to minimal changes in the testing period.
          However, communication on expandability should have had a greater precedence.
          This would've improved the quality of development further in the project's life cycle.

          <br><br>

          Our scope did estimate development time effectively.
          Although, adding a wider grace period for testing and inconviences would've greatly improved the quality of the development process.
