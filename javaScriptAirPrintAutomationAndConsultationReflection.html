        </h5>
        <p>
          Private web scripting which was created by the development team at Cove Co. for Future Institute of Australia to assist their clients kiosk service.
          Our job description was to write JavaScript that could bypass the default printing pop-up which appears on iPad browsers, and print the results of a web survey which was written in an Articulate 360 Storyline front-end.

          <br><br>
        </p>
        <h5>
          Execution
          <br><br>
        </h5>
        <p>
          Bypassing the printing pop-up on an IOS device isn't possible with raw JavaScript, which meant our first job was to consult the client on the appropriate technologies which would allow us to fulfil their job description.
          We informed them to install Kiosk Pro Enterprise.
          This allowed us to hide the pop-up when printing, and provided an extensive JavaScript API for using AirPrint.

          <br><br>

          JavaScript for the project was completed within a week, with an additional week for testing and evaluation.
          Our scripting included extensive use of the Kiosk Pro AirPrint API, and we exported and hosted a copy of our clients Articulate 360 Storyline project using Netlify's free hosting service for ease of testing.

        </h5>
        <p>
          Scoping, planning and testing for this project was completed with minimal hiccups.
          Extensive discussion, research and consultation on the execution of this project created a healthy development period.
          This was a simple and enjoyable project to work on.
